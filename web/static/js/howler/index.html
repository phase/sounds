<h1>Howler.js & The Incredible Story of Another Chrome Incompatibility</h1>
<hr>
<pre><code>
[6:41 PM] phase: Do you guys know how to go to a specific second using an HTML Audio element?
[6:42 PM] phase: audio.currentTime = second doesn't seem to work
[6:46 PM] Connor (Vectrix): Web Audio?
[6:46 PM] Connor (Vectrix): Uh
[6:52 PM] phase: yeah
[6:52 PM] phase: using the native HTML5 Audio element &lt;audio&gt;
[6:53 PM] phase: Isn't this the channel for a Digital Audio Workstation in Web Technology? ;)(edited)
[6:57 PM] phase: I'm reading that the problem is that Chrome can't handle MP3 files correctly in the audio element.
[6:57 PM] phase: If that's it I'm actually going to flip my lid.
[6:58 PM] Connor (Vectrix): That's dumb
[6:58 PM] Connor (Vectrix): In all honesty I haven't paid much attention to the web audio side
[6:59 PM] Connor (Vectrix): Just the node steams / pull stream audio side
[7:12 PM] phase: When the web client requests the song from the web server, the web server has to send a song request
    packet to the server with the database and wait for a response packet that contains the bytes for the song. Then
    the web server has to write those bytes to a temp file, convert it to an OGG, read the bytes back, and sent them
    to the web client. It does all that shit with only the smallest of hickups when it runs the audio convert command.
[7:12 PM] phase: And converting it to an OGG didn't do shit, setting the time still doesn't work.
[7:12 PM] Connor (Vectrix): @jamen
[7:13 PM] phase: Without converting the file there is literally no lag
[7:13 PM] phase: Computers are fucking fast
[7:18 PM] phase: Chrome is shit
[7:18 PM] Connor (Vectrix): I have a feeling
[7:18 PM] phase: It works completely fine on FireFox
[7:19 PM] Connor (Vectrix): you do not set the currentTime value
[7:19 PM] phase: What do you set?
[7:19 PM] Connor (Vectrix): You can start a buffer source from a specific time though for playback
[7:19 PM] Connor (Vectrix): bufferSource.start(0)
[7:19 PM] phase: that's not what I want though
[7:19 PM] Connor (Vectrix): Ok
[7:19 PM] phase: the hell are you looking at
[7:19 PM] phase: HTML Audio
[7:20 PM] phase: that's nowhere near the API docs I'm seeing
[7:20 PM] Connor (Vectrix): currentTime of type double, readonly
[7:20 PM] phase: not in FireFox
[7:20 PM] Connor (Vectrix): the variable is readonly
[7:20 PM] phase: link me that
[7:20 PM] Connor (Vectrix): https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#widl-BaseAudioContext-currentTime
[7:21 PM] Connor (Vectrix): Go here
[7:21 PM] Connor (Vectrix): https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#attributes
[7:21 PM] Connor (Vectrix): read the first one as its on currentTime
[7:23 PM] phase: https://www.webcodegeeks.com/html5/html5-audio-player-example/ says differently
[7:23 PM] phase: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_audio_currenttime.asp says differently
[7:24 PM] Connor (Vectrix): Yeah the webaudio docs say currentTime is readonly
[7:24 PM] phase: W3 also says fastSeek() is a function but it doesn't exist
[7:24 PM] Connor (Vectrix): and the one you posted doesn't
[7:24 PM] Connor (Vectrix): ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[7:24 PM] Connor (Vectrix): I think W3 is outdated
[7:24 PM] Connor (Vectrix): or that post I mean
[7:26 PM] phase: If it's outdated, doesn't that mean only new features would have been added?
[7:26 PM] phase: It works fine in FireFox, so it's a Chrome problem.
[7:29 PM] phase: The default CSS in FireFox is extremely different from Chrome...
[7:43 PM] phase: fuck it, I'm limiting the web app to only FireFox
[9:01 PM] phase: I switched to Howler.js and it works
